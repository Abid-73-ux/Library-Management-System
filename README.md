The Library Management System is a console-based project developed in Java, designed to provide a simple yet effective solution for managing users and administrators in a library environment. This project is built using arrays, loops, and functions, making it beginner-friendly while still covering essential programming concepts.

🔑 Overview

When the program starts, it welcomes the user and displays the main menu with two choices: Admin and User. Each role has its own login system and separate menus with five dedicated options. The system ensures that invalid inputs, such as incorrect credentials or wrong menu choices, do not crash the program, making it robust and reliable.

👨‍💻 Admin Role

The Admin has predefined credentials:

Username: admin

Password: admin123

After logging in, the Admin is presented with a dedicated menu of five choices, which can include managing library functions, viewing system details, and handling users.

👥 User Role

For the User, the system provides flexibility with two options: Login and Sign Up.

A predefined user exists with the credentials:

Username: user

Password: user123

New users can create accounts using the Sign Up option and later access the system through the Login option.

Each user is presented with their own menu of five different features.

⚙️ Features

Robust error handling: the system continues to run even after invalid input.

Separate menus for Admin and Users.

Ability to add multiple new users.

Clean and simple CLI interface with proper use of loops and arrays.

Uses a single Scanner object for efficient input handling.

🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of Java fundamentals like arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions to create a real-world inspired system. It serves as an excellent project for beginners to practice structured programming and build confidence in Java.
